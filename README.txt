Jan Vibe's BASIC Programs Archive
=================================

7th Feb 2022

This repository contains a version of Jan Vibe's BASIC programs archive.

The ARM Basic programs have been converted to text files. This was
done using mmb_utils's list command. The convert.sh script performs
this conversion.

The original archive can be found here:
- http://www.drobe.co.uk/extra/janvibe/programs.zip

If that link is dead, there is a copy on archive.org:
- https://web.archive.org/web/20200429130706/http://www.drobe.co.uk/extra/janvibe/programs.zip

The md5sum of the original ZIP file is:
- ef94651c9de0d238af9e529f045c7f8a

There was a very interesting interview with Jan Vibe on drobe:
- https://web.archive.org/web/20160817022506/http://www.drobe.co.uk/article.php?id=2022
It contains some hints as to what the archive contains.

The files listed below do not appear to be complete BASIC programs.

Many are Sprite data, but there are a number of BASIC fragments in
BAS09, so possibly that section of the archive is corrupt.
