# Jan Vibe's BASIC Programs Archive

7th Feb 2022

## Summary

This repository contains a version of Jan Vibe's BASIC programs archive.

The ARM Basic programs have been converted to text files. This was
done using mmb_utils's list command. The `convert.sh` script performs
this conversion.

## Contents

There are 13 separate directories of programs with different programs showing
off some of the features of the BBC and RISC OS graphics systems. Each
directory contains a README, together with screenshots and some videos of the
content:

* [BAS01](screenshots/BAS01#readme)
* [BAS02](screenshots/BAS02#readme)
* [BAS03](screenshots/BAS03#readme)
* [BAS04](screenshots/BAS04#readme)
* [BAS05](screenshots/BAS05#readme)
* [BAS06](screenshots/BAS06#readme)

  It contains some hints as to what the archive contains.

The files listed below do not appear to be complete BASIC programs.

Many are Sprite data, but there are a number of BASIC fragments in
BAS09, so possibly that section of the archive is corrupt.
